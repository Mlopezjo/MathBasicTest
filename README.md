# MathBasicTest
Based on small programs my father wrote for me in Pascal when I was 8 years old to test my math skills and allow me to play PlayStation.

I found it interesting to reproduce it in C#/.NET for my first console program.

To test it, go to the desired directory (in my case it will be 'Workspace'):
cd Workspace
git clone https://github.com/Mlopezjo/MathBasicTest.git MathBasicTest
cd MathBasicTest
dotnet build
dotnet run
